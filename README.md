# Barefoot Chef Blog revamp in Next.js and GraphQL

## Overview

This is a revamp of my personal recipe blog site. I have run this site for many years using youtube and wordpress and have just revamped it to use GraphQL and Next.js.

### Features

- **Create Blogs** - User is able to create blog posts using markdown on [the Hygraph site](https://hygraph.com/) that are added to the site. 
- **Post Comments** - Users are able to post comments on the site that are reviewed by the owner before being displayed.
- **Featured Posts** - Featured Posts are displayed in a carousel on the top of the site
- **Categories** - Allow users to search posts by category.  
- **Responsive** - Site is fully responsive.  

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Deployed on Vercel](https://barefootrecipe.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with
- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework
- [GrapQL](https://hygraph.com/) - Headless content management system that is completely GraphQL native
- Javascript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Media queries


### What I learned

(tobe continued)

- **Q Objects**
  To execute more complex queries with django ORM (for example, queries with OR statements) you need to use Q objects. I used them at multiple places in my views and they make up my simple search feature work.
